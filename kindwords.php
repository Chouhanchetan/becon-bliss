            <p>"Been a fan of Beacon Bliss for a while now. I have used the soaps, the melts, the candles and their latest- The awesome whipped soaps and scrubs. My absolute favourite. This is the kind of extra baggage I don't mind lugging around wherever I go (exactly what I did when I switched countries). With my kind of extreme dry skin, these work wonderfully well. Can't wait for you guys to start shipping internationally." </p>

            <p>""Bathing has always been a key part of ‘me time’ in my life. That’s why it needs be more of a sensory experience rather than a just functional one. Batti & Co. provides that to the fullest! The artisanal, hand crafted bars are truly a treat to the senses. Can’t wait for some more ‘me time’!"" </p>
