      <p class="y"><b>Candle Tips & Burn Instructions:</b></p>
      <p class="y">Never leave burning candles <b>unattended.</b></p>
      <p class="y"><b>First Burn</b> - Allow pool of wax to extend to outside rim of jar to set its "memory." Each time you burn the candle, it will <b>"remember"</b> to burn out to the rim. </p>
      <p class="y">For the best and safest burning of your candle, keep wick trimmed to about <b>1/4 inch</b> above the wax surface.</p>
      <p class="y"><b>Place candles in a draft-free area.</b> This can cause your candle to burn unevenly, and possibly make it tunnel.</p>
      <p class="y">Keep burning candles away from <b>children and pets.</b></p>
      <p class="y"><b>Never leave wick trimmings, matches,</b> or any other material in the wax pool as these can create a fire hazard.</p>
      <p class="y">Keep your burning candles away from any <b>flammable objects.</b></p>
      <p class="y"><b>If a wick becomes too short,</b> it will produce a flame that is too small for the candle to burn correctly. To fix this, extinguish the flame and carefully pour off the liquid wax. Relight the candle and allow it to burn for about one hour. If the flame is still too small repeat process until the flame is able to continue to burn the wax it has melted with a normal size flame.</p>
      <p class="y"> Place your candle in an area that is <b>not in direct sunlight.</b> This is purely to keep the colour of your candles looking nice and bright.</p>
      <p class="y"><b>Note:</b></p>
