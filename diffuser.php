      <p class="y">Our Diffuser Set is a power package of:</p>
      <p class="y">- 6 pcs of wax melts made with soy wax (Child & pet friendly)</p>
      <p class="y">- ceramic diffuser</p>
      <p class="y">- 4 pcs of soy wax tea light candles in acrylic containers</p>
      <p class="y"><b>What are Wax Melts?</b></p>
      <p class="y">Wax melts are scented pieces of soy wax.</p>
      <p class="y">A wax melt can give off a slight scent when cold; however, they are designed to be slowly warmed using diffuser which uses a tea light candle as its heating source or wax warmer.</p>
      <p class="y">Each piece of our wax melt will last upto 10 hours.</p>
      <p class="y">You can reuse them too!</p>
      <p class="y"><b>How To Use Wax Melts:</b></p>
      <p class="y">Wax melts are very easy to use. You simply take your wax melt and place one or more in diffuser provided. Then light your tea light under the diffuser. When you are finished using them, you just turn off or remove the heat source and the wax will solidify until you are ready to use it again.</p>
      <p class="y">When you are ready to use it again, just turn the warmer back on or light the tea light (depending on which type of warmer you have).</p>
      <p class="y">When you are ready to dispose of the used wax melts, you just allow the wax to harden, then just allow it to heat for a few minutes to loosen it and it should pop right out.</p>
